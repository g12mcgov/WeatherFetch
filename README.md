Idea
============
WeatherFetch is the new handy way to get your weather. I personally hate the iPhone weather app. It lacks detail, is often inacurate, and it requires you to open the app, wait for the data load, and try to create an outfit to wear based on the weather you're seeing. 

That's a problem. 

By signing up on WeatherFetch.com and selecting a preferable time, WeatherFetch will email you right before you wake up with a detailed weather report for your day ahead. It requests weather data from multiple sites to provide you with a broad spectrum of results. It even averages these results for the most accurate weather forecast.

Hourly forcast? Maps? Suggestions of what to wear? You betcha. And the best part is, it's all sitting there in your inbox for you to roll over and read when you wake up. We're just trying to make your life a little bitter better in the gloomy hours of the morning.

Technology
============
WeatherFetch's backend is written purely in Python. It's web-interface is written in HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and makes use of Twitter's Bootstrap Web Framework. A little bit of PHP is also there to maintain conversation with our servers. 

It's all proudly hosted on Amazon AWS.
