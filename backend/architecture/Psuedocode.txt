# Method 1: Lookup by Zipcode (Faster, but more intricate)

1. Query user database 
2. Lookup users by same zipcode. 
	Return list.
3. Lookup weather by that zip code. 
3. Now lookup time by time within that list. 
	If they have the same time and the time is rounded to the closest hour of the current time:
		 send emails to those people with weather data. 
	Else: 
		We can break out and leave. 

# Method 2: Lookup by Time (Probably slower, but makes more sense) 

1. Query user database
2. Lookup users by the current time (rounded to the nearest whole hour) 
	Return list of users (e.g. give me the 5:00am users). 
3. Lookup weather data for those users and their respective zip codes. (This might be slow... Idk... depends on the API response speed)
	Handle Data... attach it that user object. 
4. Compute averages / suggest what to wear for that particular day 
5. Iterate through users send email: 
	Here's what we need: 
		Name 
		Email address 
		HTML Body: (call HTML Generate function with passed in args, return HTML)
			Zip code 
			Time 
			Weather (from multiple sources) 	
			Suggestions what to wear
